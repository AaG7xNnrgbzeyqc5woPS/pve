QEMU (short form for Quick Emulator) is an open source hypervisor that emulates a physical computer. From the perspective of the host system where QEMU is running, QEMU is a user program which has access to a number of local resources like partitions, files, network cards which are then passed to an emulated computer which sees them as if they were real devices.

A guest operating system running in the emulated computer accesses these devices, and runs as if it were running on real hardware. For instance, you can pass an ISO image as a parameter to QEMU, and the OS running in the emulated computer will see a real CD-ROM inserted into a CD drive.

QEMU can emulate a great variety of hardware from ARM to Sparc, but Proxmox VE is only concerned with 32 and 64 bits PC clone emulation, since it represents the overwhelming majority of server hardware. The emulation of PC clones is also one of the fastest due to the availability of processor extensions which greatly speed up QEMU when the emulated architecture is the same as the host architecture.
 	
**NOTE**
>> You may sometimes encounter the term KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine). It means that QEMU is running with the support of the virtualization processor extensions, via the Linux KVM module. In the context of Proxmox VE QEMU and KVM can be used interchangeably, as QEMU in Proxmox VE will always try to load the KVM module.

QEMU inside Proxmox VE runs as a root process, since this is required to access block and PCI devices.

## Emulated devices and paravirtualized devices

The PC hardware emulated by QEMU includes a mainboard, network controllers, SCSI, IDE and SATA controllers, serial ports (the complete list can be seen in the kvm(1) man page) all of them emulated in software. All these devices are the exact software equivalent of existing hardware devices, and if the OS running in the guest has the proper drivers it will use the devices as if it were running on real hardware. This allows QEMU to runs unmodified operating systems.

This however has a performance cost, as running in software what was meant to run in hardware involves a lot of extra work for the host CPU. To mitigate this, QEMU can present to the guest operating system paravirtualized devices, where the guest OS recognizes it is running inside QEMU and cooperates with the hypervisor.

QEMU relies on the virtio virtualization standard, and is thus able to present paravirtualized virtio devices, which includes a paravirtualized generic disk controller, a paravirtualized network card, a paravirtualized serial port, a paravirtualized SCSI controller, etc â€¦

**Tip**
>> It is highly recommended to use the virtio devices whenever you can, as they provide a big performance improvement and are generally better maintained. Using the virtio generic disk controller versus an emulated IDE controller will double the sequential write throughput, as measured with bonnie++(8). Using the virtio network interface can deliver up to three times the throughput of an emulated Intel E1000 network card, as measured with iperf(1). [1]
