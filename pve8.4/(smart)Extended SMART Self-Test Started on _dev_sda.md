## Extended SMART Self-Test Started on /dev/sda

- The extended SMART self-test has been successfully started on `/dev/sda`.
- Estimated duration: **348 minutes** (~5 hours 48 minutes).
- Expected completion time: **Sat Jun 7 04:02:00 2025 CST**.
- The test runs in the background; your system and disk remain operational.
- To abort the test (if absolutely necessary), use:

```bash
smartctl -X /dev/sda
```


---

## Next Steps

1. **Wait for the test to complete** at the estimated time.
2. After completion, retrieve the test results and any errors with:
```bash
smartctl -a /dev/sda
```

3. Review the **Self-test log section** for any failures or warnings.
4. Based on the results, decide whether to continue using the disk, further diagnose, or replace it.

## Tips While Waiting

- Continue monitoring your ZFS pool status with:

```bash
zpool status tank
```

- Keep your backups current to avoid data loss.
- Check physical connections (SATA cables, power) to reduce communication errors.

If you want, I can remind you how to check the results after the test finishes or help interpret the output. Just let me know!
