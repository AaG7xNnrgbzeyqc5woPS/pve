#  Remove a Cluster Node 
- **Read the procedure carefully before proceeding, as it may not be what you want or need.**

  
## 备份节点上的数据
1，Move all virtual machines from the node.
   迁移节点上的所有的虚拟机
2，Ensure that you have made copies of any local data or backups that you want to keep. 
  节点上的本地数据或者备份数据都要做拷贝
3，In addition, make sure to remove any scheduled replication jobs to the node to be removed.
   另外，节点的计划复制也要全部删除

> Failure to remove replication jobs to a node before removing said node will result in the replication job becoming irremovable. Especially note that replication automatically switches direction if a replicated VM is migrated, so by migrating a replicated VM from a node to be deleted, replication jobs will be set up to that node automatically.
